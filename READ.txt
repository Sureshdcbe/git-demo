###Animal Story

This page contains Animal Stories about their human and non-human animal relationships. Read these short stories about dogs, cats, Brer Rabbit, birds, fish, and other crazy critters. Some of them are sad, some are funny, and some are both. Others tell of humans turning to God because of the death of a non-human animal. But one thing that all of these stories have in common is that they will touch your heart and soul.
